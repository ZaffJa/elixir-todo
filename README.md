# TODO
This project purpose is to put everything I've learned about elixir.

Some of the roadmaps are:
- realtime chat app
- stress-test (see how this application handles hundreds of thousands of connection)
- our all time favourite, `Hello World`
- [Learn Functional Programming With Elixir](https://pragprog.com/book/cdc-elixir/learn-functional-programming-with-elixir)
- probably a library management system as well


To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `make setup`. (Only run this once to setup everything properly)
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `make up`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
